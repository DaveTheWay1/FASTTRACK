## Display Balance
Upong the user add their current balance, that balance will display at the top to then
change whenever a user applies a cost or payment. Below is the original amount so that users
will always have in mind the amount they actually currently have. Purposely, no delete here as the idea is that they wont need to delete but only update their balance whenever they login.

## Cost, Payments, and Additional Purchases
Displayed below are the monthly costs/payments the user decides to include. Each with an edit and delete but most importantly an apply. The idea here is that users will go based off the date their visiting the app and apply certain costs/payment that are upcoming up to a certain date of their choice. Overall -- helping users see where they will be financially will the applied costs/payments.

## Delete View
Below is also what all the delete views basically look like. However, some do not have a confirm delete. Additional Purchases does not have a confirm delete because that idea is since its not consistent like the others you can simply and confidently remove it.

## Reset
After the user has applied all costs and expenses, or made an error within the process, or would like to try differently - the current balance is presented with a reset button. When the user clicks to reset, the balance will go back to its original.
